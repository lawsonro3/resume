# 24 September 2018 - For bat and wind turbine interaction proposal
Michael Lawson a senior scientist in the Wind and Water power program at NREL. His research focuses on numerical modeling of wind turbines using both high-fidelity CFD and reduced order numerical modeling techniques. Dr. Lawson has significant experience in numerical simulation code development and performance modeling of wind turbine systems and is currently supporting the Office of Science ExaWind Exascale Computing Project and the EERE A2e Wind Farm High Fidelity Modeling Project. For the past 7 years, Michael has also worked with NRELâ€™s environmental scientists to study bat interactions with wind turbines using computational fluid dynamics models. Michael brings significant project management experience and has served as an M&O contractor to DOE in Washington D.C. for two years, supporting the A2e initiative.
