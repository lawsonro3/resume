**2017-2022: Senior Scientist | Marine Energy Platform Lead**    
**Wind and Water Power Program. National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Boulder, CO**

* Supported the oversight and management of a $20M+ marine energy R&D portfolio at NREL.
* Helped guide the rapid expansion of the NREL Water Power Program as it grew from approximately 15 full time staff in 2017 to more than 30 full time staff in 2021.
* Lead the development of four successful ARPA-E SHARKS (Submarine Hydrokinetic And Riverine Kilo-megawatt Systems) proposals, including one prime award. These awards lead to over $1.4M in funding to NREL.
* Supported the DOE Water Power Technologies office in (1) the development of the DOE Marine and Hydrokinetic Program Strategy, (2) in the development of DOE funding opportunity announcements, and (3) in the management of industry projects.
* Worked with a large multi-lab team to develop a blade-resolved wind farm simulation capability using the Nalu CFD code, with the ultimate goal of developing an exascale wind farm CFD modeling tool.
* Studied bat barotrauma from an aerodynamics perspective to help determine the likelihood that barotrauma is a significant contributor to wind turbine-related bat fatalities.
* Studied wind turbine wake propagation under stable atmospheric conditions using the SOWFA CFD tool in order to understand wake physics with the objective of informing simplified wind farm wake models and developing wind farm control strategies.

**2015-2017: Technical Advisor**    
**Wind and Water Power Technologies Office. U.S. Department of Energy. Washington, D.C.**

* Technical expert from NREL assigned to support the DOE wind and water power programs.
* Provided technical support for the Department of Energy Wind Program's Atmosphere to Electrons (A2e) program. A2e has the objective of using modern high performance computing and experimental techniques to optimize the performance of wind plants in order to significantly reduce the cost of wind energy.
* Collaborated with Department of Energy staff to develop a U.S. strategy for the development of wave and tidal, ocean, and river current energy technologies.
* Developed funding opportunities to support the deployment of utility-scale wave and tidal/ocean/river current technologies and supported the evaluation of applications.
* Provided technical support for Department of Energy funded National Lab and industry projects.
* Supported the economic analysis and evaluation of wave and tidal/ocean/river current energy technologies.

**2012-2014: Scientist**    
**Water Power Program. National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Boulder, CO**

* PI on the team developing WEC-Sim, an open-source wave energy converter simulation tool that has been widely adopted by industry and academia. The WEC-Sim project was a 4-year NREL-Sandia collaboration. I was the NREL lead developing the WEC-Sim project proposal and once the project was awarded I helped managing an NREL budget of more than $1M per year and coordinating work between researchers at NREL and Sandia.
* Co-PI on an LDRD project with the objective of developing WEC technologies that have the ability to utilize advanced control strategies to improve performance and reduce loads on wave energy converters. I was the lead on the proposal development team and was responsible for management of the 3-year / $750K project
* Designed and analyzed a wave energy converters and tidal/ocean current turbines using experimental methods and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations as Part of the DOE Reference Model Project.
* Performed a techno-economic assessment of wave and tidal current energy technologies for the Unites States.

**2010-2012: Postdoctoral Researcher**    
**Water Power Program. National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Boulder, CO**

* Developed a new version of the axial-flow rotor optimization code HARP-Opt.
* Developed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods to simulate tidal current turbines.
* Developed a discrete vortex method code to simulate vertical axis turbines.

**2007-2010: National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellow**
